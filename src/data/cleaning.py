# This file will contain functions for data cleaning
# For now, we'll leave it as a placeholder

def clean_games_data(df):
    # Implement data cleaning logic here
    # For example:
    # - Handle missing values
    # - Convert data types
    # - Remove duplicates
    # - Standardize column names
    pass

# Add more cleaning functions as needed
