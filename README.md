# College Football Predictor 2024

## Overview

I joined a college football pool this year with a few friends. I thought it would be fun to try and use machine learning to make picks that win more than 50% of the time.

## Outline

1. Scrape data from the [CollegeFootballData.com API](https://collegefootballdata.com/)
2. Clean and process the data
3. Explore the data and create features
4. Build a model to predict the outcome of each game
5. Use the model to make picks for the season
6. Evaluate the picks
7. Make picks for the rest of the season
